N_spins works well, but the results were not compared to the theoretical prediction

Plan:
1. Calculate by hand 2 spin system and compare with the results of the simulation
2. Make a class that generates Hamiltonian for the N-spin system and compare with the results

Sub-plan:
1:
- Exact solution
- Solve with netket
- Visualization

# N_spins

Input is a hamiltonian (input is a wave funciton and output a wave function after the application of the hamiltonian), and number of spins in the chain.

Searches for the wavefunction that gives the lowest energy

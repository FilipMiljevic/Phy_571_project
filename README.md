# Phy_571_project

Plan:
1. Solve ground state for 2 spins
2. Solve ground state for N spins
3. So far scipy.optimize.minimize, use more efficient method

Sub-plan:
1:
- Solve for real network weights
- Solve for complex network weights
- Exact solution
- Solve with netket
- Visualization

Done so far:
- Two_qubits works only for the real weights with scipy
